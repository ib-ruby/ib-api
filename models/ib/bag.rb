  # "BAG" is not really a contract, but a combination (combo) of securities.
  # AKA basket or bag of securities. Individual securities in combo are represented
  # by ComboLeg objects.

    # General Notes:
    # 1. :exchange for the leg definition must match that of the combination order.
    # The exception is for a STK legs, which must specify the SMART exchange.
    # 2. :symbol => "USD" For combo Contract, this is an arbitrary value (like "USD")
